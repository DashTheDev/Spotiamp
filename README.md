# What is it?

Spotiamp is a now-abandoned tribute to Winamp made by a Spotify developer. I like the compactness and customizability of Winamp, and I am a Spotify user, so it made sense to use it, and update it a bit to my liking.

## How was it made?
Originally I was modifying the original executable, but there's only so far that can get you. unfortunately, despite the program being open source, it used an older type of API authentication which meant that obtaining a new key was completely impossible. that being the only obstacle between me and compiling the source code, I reverse engineered the original executable to obtain the key, and put it into the source code.
